<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She walks with the wind on the windy height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the rocks are loud and the waves are white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all night long she calls through the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"O, my children, come home!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bleak gown, torn as a tattered cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tosses around her like a shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While over the deep her voice rings loud,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i3">O, my children, come home!"<br /></span>

<span class="i3">"O, my children, come home!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose face is raised to the blinding gale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hair blows black and whose eyes are pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While over the world is heard her wail,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"O, my children, come home, come home!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">O, my children, come home!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She walks with the wind in the windy wood;<br /></span>

<span class="i3">O, my children, come home!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who is she who shudders by<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who walks all night with her wailing cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"O, my children, come home!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, strange of look, and wild of tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pale feet wounded and hands wan-wrung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeps on and on with her cry, far-flung,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Spirit of Autumn, pierced with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling her children home again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death and Dreams, through ruin and rain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Among her blackberry-lilies, low that lean<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The sleepy bees make hardly any sound;<br /></span>

<p class="center">WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS, in the <i>North American Review</i>
for January, 1902.</p>

<p>"One never praises an author for certain things without afterward
doubting if they were the characteristic things, or whether just the
reverse might not be said. Praise is, in fact, a delicate business, and I,
who am rather fond of dealing in it, never feel quite safe. Not only is it
questionable at the moment, but the later behavior of the author is sometimes
such that one is sorry not to have made it blame. It is always with
a shrinking, which I try to hide from the public, that I take up the fresh
venture of a poet whom I have once bet on. But there is a joy when I
find that I have not lost my wager, which is full compensation for the
anxiety suffered. This joy has lately been mine in the latest little book
of Mr. Madison Cawein, whose work I long ago confessed my pleasure in.
I am not sure that he has transcended the limits which he then seemed
to give himself as the lover, the prophet, of beauty in the woods and
waters and skies of the southern Mid-West. I do not know that he need
have done more than unlock the riches of emotion within these limits.
What I am sure of is that in 'Weeds by the Wall' he has more deeply
charmed me with an art perfected from that I felt in 'Blooms of the
Berry' ten or fifteen years since. Many little books of his have come (I
hope not also gone) between the first and last, and none of them has
failed to make me glad of his work; and now, again, I am finding the same
impassioned moods in the same impassive presences. To my knowledge,
no such nature poems have been written within the time since Mr. Cawein
began to write as his are, or from such an intimacy with the 'various
language' which nature speaks. There are other good poems in the book,
poems which would have made reputes in the eighteenth century, and
which it would be a shame not to own good in the twentieth; but those
which speak for 'The Cricket,' ' A Twilight Moth,' 'The Grasshopper,'
'The Tree-Toad,' 'The Screech Owl,' 'The Chipmunk,' 'Drouth,' 'Before
the Rain,' and the like, are in a voice which interprets the very soul of
what we call the inarticulate things, though they seem to have enunciated
themselves so distinctly to this poet. It is cheap to note his increasing
control of his affluent imagery and the growing mastery that makes him
so fine an artist. These things were to be expected from his early poems,
but what makes one think he will go far and long, and outlive both praise
and blame, is the blending of a sense of the Kentucky civilization in
such a poem as 'Feud.'... Civilization may not be quite the word for
the condition of things suggested here, but there can be no doubt of the
dramatic and the graphic power that suggests it, and that imparts a personal
sense of the tragic squalor, the sultry drouth, the forlorn <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wickednsse'">wickedness</ins>
of it all. By such a way as this lies Mr. Cawein's hope of rise from nature
up to man, if it is up; and also, as I perceive too late, lies confusion for
the critic who said that the poet does not transcend the limits he once
seemed to give himself."</p>
